# LLM_finetuning
Welcome to the LLM Finetuning project! This project aims to enhance Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities for Amharic language by fine-tuning language models for quality embedding and text generation. The project addresses the lack of extensive, high-quality text and audio datasets for these languages, enabling various NLP applications such as semantic search, content generation, chatbot support, sentiment analysis, and speech recognition.
